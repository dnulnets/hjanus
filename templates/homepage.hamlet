          Janus â€” a software development tracker
        <p>
          Track risks, user needs, requirements, verifications, validations and handles traceability, releases, versions, baselines of records and compliance with parts of IEC62304.
        <p>
          The focus of the Janus project is to create a free and open source software development tracker that contains the bare minimum to allow it to be compliant to parts
          of IEC62304 but still versitile enough to allow for tailoring to a more advanced setup.
